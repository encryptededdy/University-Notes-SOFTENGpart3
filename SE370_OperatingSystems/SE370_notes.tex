\section{Lecture 1}
	\subsection{Generics}
		\paragraph{\tab Operating System} The software that makes the computer usable. Using modern computers without an OS is "impossible"
			\\ \tab \textbf{Examples: }Windows, OSX, Linux, Unix, iOS, Android, etc...

		% \paragraph{\tab Things that are part of an OS?}
		% \begin{enumerate}
		% 	\item File System
		% 	\item Communication System
		% 	\item Process Manager
		% 	\item Security Manager
		% 	\item Memory Manager
		% 	\item Graphical User Interface
		% 	\item Backup System
		% 	\item Web Browser
		% 	\item Media Player
		% 	\item Compiler
		% 	\item Java/.Net environment.
		% \end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Approaches to Understanding}
		\paragraph{\tab Minimalist}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item mostly going to be using this one
			\item OS contains minimum amount of software to function
			\item archlike
		\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{\tab Maximalist}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item All software comes with standard OS release.
			\item Contains many utilities and programs.
			\item ubuntuish
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{Usable vs Efficient}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item make sure you make OS suited for needs
			\item either specialised or more general purpose
			\item Think of who you expect to use the system
			\item If creating a realtime system with potentially thousands of operations in a short amount of time, have to consider efficiency
			\item Same with battery life if you expect the system to be used in a mobile setting.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsection{OS themes}
		\paragraph{\tab Manager Model}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item OS is colleciton of managers, ensuring proper use of devices.
				\item Managers are independent.
				\item look out for everything associated with computer 
				\item tie in with hardware. Current state of HW lets OS do more/less things
			\end{itemize}


		\paragraph{\tab Onion Model}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Onions have layers (Abstractions)
				\item resources contained in lower layers. 
				\item Lower layers can't access higher level layers but other way around possible
				\item Very difficult to get these layers 'right'
				\item can use in terms of security. Very good idea
			\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{\tab Resource Allocator Model}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item similar to manager model
				\item emphasis on fairness and providing services
			\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{\tab Dustbin Model}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item contains middleware that not considered part of OS
				\item Sees OS as bits no-one wants to do
			\end{itemize}

		\paragraph{\tab Getting Work Done Model}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Idea of it is we use computers to do something else.
				\item Goal for OS is to help be able to get it all done.
			\end{itemize}

	% Things we should know
	% 	Interrupt
	% 	Security&Protection
	% 	FileSystem
	% 	VirtualMemory
	% 	Processes&Threads

	\subsection{OS design}
		\subsubsection{Themes}
			\paragraph{\tab All in one}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item All OS components freely interact with each other
				\item MS-DOR and Early Linux
			\end{itemize}

			\paragraph{\tab Separate Layers (Onion Model)}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Simplify verificiation and debugging
				\item Correct design difficult to get
			\end{itemize}

			\paragraph{\tab Modules}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item All in one with modules for some features
				\item Linux and Windows.
			\end{itemize}

			\paragraph{\tab Microkernels}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Client/Server model
				\item make OS as small as possible

				\item \textbf{Exokernel} puts kernel outside. OS's job only need to authenticate people to use hardware.
			\end{itemize}

			\paragraph{\tab VMs}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Java is an example of this
			\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{MS-DOS}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Written to provide the most functionality in the least amount of space
			\item not divided into modules
			\item Something exokernels trying to do. Make application program access hardware directly.
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{Early Unix}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item UNIX OS in 2 parts. \textbf{Kernel} and \textbf{System Programs}
			\item Provides:
				\begin{itemize}
					\item File System
					\item CPU sheduling
					\item Memory management
					\item Other OS functions
				\end{itemize}
			\item Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
			\item Make OS as simple as possible.
			\item Simple 2 letter commands.
			\item Ideas of pipelining and process communication
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{THE Multiprogramming System}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item THE was the first to use the layered system
			\item Contains 6 layers:
				\begin{enumerate}
					\item[5] User programs
					\item[4] Input/Output buffering
					\item[3] Operator-Console device driver
					\item[2] Memory Management
					\item[1] CPU scheduling
					\item[0] Hardware
				\end{enumerate}
		\end{itemize}

	\subsubsection{WinNT and Client/Server}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item WinNT still being still run
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Win10 now has Windows Subsystem for Linux
				\end{itemize}
			\item NT provide env subsystem to run code written for differnt OS
			\item NT and successors are hybrid systems. Parts are layered but some merged to improve performance.
		\end{itemize}

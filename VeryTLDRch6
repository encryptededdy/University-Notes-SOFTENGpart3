Chapter 5 - Link Layer
	5.1 - Introduction
		- responsible for transferring packet from one node to physically adjacent node over link.
		-  In every host through NIC

		Services
			Flow control
				Keep good pace between sending nodes

			Error Detection
				- Find errors caused by things like noise
				- Receiver detects these errors

			Error Correction
				Receiver IDs and correct errors without retransmission

			Half/Full Duplex
				Half: only one way concurrent transmission
				Full: both way concurrent transmission

	5.2 - Error Detection/Correction
		Is not 100% reliable

		Parity check 
			- On both x y, and bits

		Internet Checksum
			- Treat everything as 16bit int and make checksum to put into UDP checksum field
			- Receiver recompute to check

		Cyclic Redundancy Check
			- Better/Powerful error detection

			[DO CRC algorithm here]

	5.3 - MAC
		- Is broadcast link and not point to point. (Sharing medium)
		- Therefore have to accomodate for collisions somehow

		Channel Partitioning

	5.4 - LANs

	5.5 - Link virtualisation MPLS

	5.6 - Data centre networking

	5.7 - day in life of web request

SE364 Catherine's Section TLDR notes

Chapter 1 - Introduction
	1.1 - What is the Internet
		Internet: Billions of connected devices that run network applications
		
		- Bandwidth: Rate of data transfer
		- Packets are forwarded by switches
		- End systems run protocols that control sending/receiving of information

		Standards
			RFC		Request for comments
			IETF	Internet Engineering Task Force

		Service View
		- Provides services to applications
		- Provides programming interface to applications.

		Protocol
		Define format, order of messages sent/received amongst entities.

	1.2 - Network Edge
		Network Structure
			Network Edge
			- Hosts run applications and are clients and servers
			- Servers located in data centres

			Access Network/Physical Media
			- Wired, or wireless communication links

			Network Core
			- Interconnected Routers
			- Network of networks

		Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
			- Uses pre-existing phone lines 
			- Uses Access multiplexors (DSLAM)

			Internet: goes to internet line after the phone line
			Phone: goes to telephone line after the phone line

			<2.5Mb/s UPLOAD		<24Mb/s DOWNLOAD

		Cable Network
			- Uses frequency division multiplexing to divide types of data being transmitter over it.
			- Uses cable TV infrastructure & shares broadcast medium

			HFC (Hybrid fibre coax)
			2Mb/s UPLOAD		30Mb/s DOWNLOAD

		Ethernet/Enterprise Access Network
			- Used in large scale scenarios
			- High transmission rates (from 10Mb/s to 10Gb/s)

		Wireless Access
			Having a robust redisential  network infrastructure is important
			- WLAN (local) and within building
			- WWAN (wide) provided by telecommunications provider (cellular data)

		Physical media
			Guided Media = Data travels in specified medium (wire)
			Unguided Media = travels freely (radio)

			Twisted Pair (TP)
				- 2 insulated copper wires
				- CAT5=100/1000mbs, CAT6=10gbs

			Coaxial cable
				- 2 Copper conductors
				- Bidirectional, broadband

			Fibre
				- Glass fibres carry information through light pulses.
				- High throughput (100Gbs) with low error rate (No EMI)

			Radio
				- Uses radio waves, bidirectional
				- Heavily affected by environment

				Microwave, LAN/WiFi, WWAN, Satellite

	1.3 - Network Core
		General
			- Send messages, but first need to break it up into packets
			- Takes L/R to send packet through link.
			- Entire packet must be recieved before it can be transmitted.
			- End-to-end delay = 2L/R (zero propagation delay)
			- FDM = Frequency Division Multiplexing
			- TDM = Time Division Multiplexing
		
		Delay & Loss
			- Due to whole packet having to be there before can be passed further, causes queue
			- If more packets arrive than queue can handle then packet dropped and have to be resent

		Functions
			Routing: determine path for packets to take
			Forwarding: move packets from router to router

		Circuit Switching
			- When connection established, act as if physical connection exists between 2 hosts
			- Only disconnected when all transactions done
			- Maximum throughput as segment is locked by pair
			- Unused segments remain idle

		Packet Switching
			- Lets more users use network than circuit switch
			- Messages broken down into parts that are sent independantly
			- N users with each having bandwidth of total bandwidth.

		Architecture
			- End system connect to ISP
			- ISPs connect to global ISPs through IXPs

	1.4 - Delay, Loss & Throughput
		How
			- Can lose packet of queue used up, next packed dropped.

		Packet Delay
			- Nodal Processing: check bit, determining output link
			- Queuing Delay: Waiting for output link for transmission
			- Transmission Delay: time to push packet to network
			- Propagation Delay: length of physical link

			Traffic intensity
			- 0 = small queuing delay
			- approaching 1 = large queuing delay
			- > 1 = more work arriving then can be processed (loss)

		Traceroute
			- Will let you figure out path packet takes, and delays for each one

		Packet Loss 
			- dropped when queue full. May or may not be retransmitted

		Throughput
			- rate that bits can be transfered between sender and receiver
			- Instantaneous and average throughput
			- Only as good as bottleneck (in whole system)

	1.5 - Protocol Layers
		Why: To identify relationships between sections of internet.

		Application Layer: Network applications (HTTP)
		Transport Layer: process-process data transfer (TCP)
		Network Layer: Routing of datagrams from source to dest (IP)
		Link Layer: Transfer data between neighbouring elements (802.11, Ethernet)
		Phyiscal Layer: bits on wire

		ISO/OSI
			- Adds presentation and session betweenn application and transport layer

			Presentation: application interpreting data
			Session: synchronising data. Recovery of data

		Encapsulation
			- Things in different layers contained in own wrapper denoted by a header in packet. One header for each protocol

	1.6 - Networks Under Attack: Security
		Internet not originally created with security in mind.

		Malware
			- Virus: self replicating infection received by executing something
			- Worm: Self replication infection by passively receiving object that self executes
		DDOS: bogus TCP connections that saturate connection and mean legitimate traffic can't get through.

		Packet Sniffing: looking at your packets
		IP Spoofing: pretending you're someone else by using their IP address

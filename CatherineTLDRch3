Chapter 3 - Transport Layer
	3.1 - Transport Layer Services
		General
			- Provides logical communication between app processes on different hosts
			- transport protocol run on end system
			- breakup sending app msg, remake received app msgs

		Network & Transport layer
			NETWORK: logical communcation between hosts
			TRANSPORT: logical communication between processes

		Protocols
			TCP: reliable with congestion/flow control
			UDP: unreliable but fast

			- Neither guarantee delays or bandwidth

	3.2 - Multiplexing and Demultiplexing
		MULTIPLEXING
			- done at sender
			- handle data from multiple sockets
			- add transport header

		DEMULTIPLEXING
			- done at receiver
			- send received packet to right socket

			Datagram
				- source & dest IP 
				- source & dest port#
			Host uses IPaddress + Port# to send segment to right socket

		Connectionless Demultiplexing (UDP)
			- when get UDP segment check port# and send segment to relevant socket

			IPdatagram wth same dest&port# but different sourceIP/sourcePort# will be put in same socket at dest

		Connection Oriented Demultiplexing (TCP)
			4-tuple ID for TCP socket
			- Source IP
			- Source Port#
			- Dest IP
			- Dest Port#

			-Demultiplexing uses all 4 values to find correct socket
			-host may have multiple TCP connections and therefore IDed by the 4tuple
			- Web servers handle differently, have different socket for each connecting client

			All destined to IPaddr B on same port have different socket if different src

Chapter 5 - Link Layer
	5.1 - Introduction
		- responsible for transferring packet from one node to physically adjacent node over link.
		-  In every host through NIC

		Services
			Flow control
				Keep good pace between sending nodes

			Error Detection
				- Find errors caused by things like noise
				- Receiver detects these errors

			Error Correction
				Receiver IDs and correct errors without retransmission

			Half/Full Duplex
				Half: only one way concurrent transmission
				Full: both way concurrent transmission

	5.2 - Error Detection/Correction
		Is not 100% reliable

		Parity check 
			- On both x y, and bits

		Internet Checksum
			- Treat everything as 16bit int and make checksum to put into UDP checksum field
			- Receiver recompute to check

		Cyclic Redundancy Check
			- Better/Powerful error detection

			[DO CRC algorithm here]

	5.3 - MAC
		- Is broadcast link and not point to point. (Sharing medium)
		- Therefore have to accomodate for collisions somehow
		- Cable access is MAC

		Channel Partitioning
			- Dividing to smaller pieces
			- Tries to not have collisions

			>TDMA time division multiple access
			- Similar to time division multiplex
			- unused slots idle

			>FDMA Frequency Division Multiple Access
			- Similar to Frequency division multiplex
			- unused slots still idle

		Random Access
			- Channel not divided
			- Have to recover from collisions

			>Slotted ALOHA
			- time broken into sections
			- If free then transmit
			- if collision then abort, then with probability retransmit at next window.
			- 37% efficiency

			>Unslotted ALOHA (pure)
			- not time based unlike slotted
			- if free then transmit
			- if collision then percentage try again after some time
			- 18% efficiency due to collision before and after

			>CSMA Carrier Sense Multiple Access
			- if idle trandmit whole frame
			- if busy, wait
			- issues with propogation delay and collisions

			>CSMA/CD (CSMA with collision detection)
			- If collision then both abort
			- Then add number to range, choose number in that range, wait that amount of time then try again
			- best when Dprop is 0 or when Ttime is infinite

		Taking Turns
			- Nodes take turns to do their own thing which make take different times

			>Polling
			- Master goes around asking slaves if they want to transmit
			- single point of failure (master)
			- latency issue

			>Token Passing
			- pass token around, if got token then transmit otherwise don't.
			- Someone can forget to pass token or hog it for long time.

		DOCSIS
			- Uses both FDM and TDM.
			- TDM on some things that need persistent connection

	5.4 - LANs
		5.4.1 - Addressing, ARP
			MAC address
				-32 bit IP address. Network layer
				- Used to get frame from one interface to another physically connected one.

			ARP Address Resolution Protocol
				Table of devices in LAN based off IP address, MAC address and TTL (20min avg)

				- Broadcast IP address and FFFFF to everyone to get that guy's MAC address
				- Use IP and MAC to route from A to B

		5.4.2 - Ethernet
			- Cheap and fast
			- Used to be shared bus, now use start with switch in the middle

			Frame structure
			|preamble|destAddr|srcAddr|type|payload|CRC|
			- Preamble = 7 bytes

			- Connectionless and unreliable (no handshaking)
			- Data in dropped frame lost unless 

			- Ethernet MAC protocol: unslotted CSMA/CD with binary backoff

			- Has many standards

		5.4.3 - Switches
			Ethernet Switch
				- Ethernet switch is link layer device with active role.
				- Store and forward Ethernet frames.
				- Try to be transparent so host unaware of presence of these.
				- Self learning and plug&play

				- Hosts directly communciate to switch
				- switches buffer packets and Ethernet used on each link with full duplex

				- if A->B and C-> then no collision, only buffering occurs when one host expecting multiple packets

			Forwarding Table
				- ARP has IP and MAC
				- Switch table has MAC and interface linking it and host
				- Self learning through TTL

				if sent packet
					check MAC address
					if exist in table
						if src = dst
							drop frame
						else
							send that way
					else
						flood every other interface in case

				- Switches can be connected to other switches and have same effect

			Switches vs Routers
				- both store&forward
					switches: link layer
					router: network layer
				- both use forwarding tables
					switches: learned through flooding and MAC addresses
					routers: use routing algorithms and IP addresses

		5.4.4 - VLANs
			General
				- Basically making multiple LAN from a single physical LAN. Cheaper than doing it physically
				- Moving people around is more expensive physically.
				- good  for security/privacy purposes

			Port based VLAN
				- ports on switch organised such that each block is allocated to a VLAN
				- Is only logical split

				Traffic isolation
				- Frames to/from 1-8 can only go to/from 1-8
				- ports can be dynamically added/modified at a later date.

				Spanning multiple switches
				TRUNK PORT: carries frames between VLANs defined over multiple switches.
				- Allgood since only logical split and not physical split so can share this
				- Must be over 802.1q must be used
					- adds addition header information needed for trunk port stuffs

	5.5 - Link virtualisation MPLS
		[ Multiprotocol Label Switching ]
		Goal: high speed IP forwarding using fixed length label (instead of IP addr)
		- Fast lookup instead of longest prefix
		- datagram still has IP addr

		MPLS routers
		- forwarding only based on label
		- doesn't look at IPaddr
		- decisions can be altered
		- All routers have to support it for it to be usable

		-IP determined by destIP alone
		- MPLS based on srcIP and destIP

		Table
		- consists of out label, destination and out interface
		- if have label then will have given destination.
		- Out label of prev is in label of next

	5.6 - Data centre networking
		PROBLEM
			- have many clients to serve
			- have to manage and balance load, and bottlenecks

			Load Balancing
			- Having a dedicated piece hardware route things on switches to so client doesn't have to worry where data is stored, and just that they get it

			Data Centre Networks
			- Multiple tiers of switches with redundant connections in case of failure. Also increases throughput

	5.7 - day in life of web request
		- connect laptop to network
		- make DHCP request to get IPaddr
		- Ethernet demux to IP to UDP to DHCP
		- Siwtch learning to figure out how to switch to you
		- you make HTTP request to google.com
		- request made to local DNS
			- either return cached
			- or do iterative 
		-

Chapter 4 - Network Layer
	4.1 - Overview of Network Layer
		- network layer protocols in every host and router
		- router looks at headers in datagrams that pass through

		Forwarding: move packet from input to correct output
		Routing: Determine how packet goes from src to dest

		4.1.1 - Data Plane
			- Local & per router
			- Determine where to put received datagram on output port
			- does forwaring

		4.1.2 - Control Plane
			- Network wide logic
			- Determine how datagram routed

			2 approaches
			- traditionally implemented in routers
				- routing algorithm in every router in control plane.
			- decentralised SDN (software defined networking) to do computation.
				- distinct remote server interacts with routers.

		Network Service Model 
			[DONT EVEN KNOW]

		4.3.4 - Network Address Translation

		4.3.5 - IPv6

	4.4 - Generalised Forward and SDN

Lecture 1: Usability Evaluation
	Learning Objectives:
		- Define usability
		- Describe aspects & Mesures of context
		- Compare/Contrast usability evaluation techniques
		- Use correct evaluation technique for problem

	1.1: Usability
		- Measures quality of user experience when using product
		- Quality attribute, assess how easy interface is to use

		-Ensure user can use system as it was intended to be used
		- Many examples of bad usability, can be solved easily


	1.2: Fit for use: 
		- Can system support tasks user wants to do?
		- Usability testing != System testing
		- Can create metric to measure error frequency (Such as 2 errors per hour)

	1.3: Ease of Learning: 
		- How fast can new user learn to do basic task on system
		- Are you expected to read a manual?
		- How much time do you invest learning interface?

	1.4: Efficiency of use: 
		- How fast can experienced user finish task?
		- Would it be quicker to order pizza on phone or do it online?

	1.5: Memorability: 
		- Can user remember where things are, if they've used the system before.
		- Interface good if you can recall how to do someting
		- If you expect a user to do something often then expect them to have remembered how to do it
		- Make a feature that you don't expect to be used as simple as possible

	1.6: Error Frequency & Severity: 
		- How often/serious are errors that users encounter when user uses system.
		- Think of the cost of a specific error happening
		- Try changing input type to prevent various incorrect options

		Slip = Understand goal but incorrect action
		Mistake = May not even have correct goal, as well as incorrect action

	1.7: Subjective Satisfaction: 
		- Does user like using system?
		- If do then probably will make less errors
		- Aesthetics very important. Ugly may be tiring for the user.

	1.8: Performance Measurements
		Analytical = directly from interface
		Empirical = Observed from usability study

		1.8.1: Fitt's Law:
			The larger the distance or the smaller the targer, the longer it takes for user to do task. LOG RELATIONSHIP

		1.8.2: Hick-Hyman Law:
			Time taken to make decision for N choices increases by LOG FACTOR

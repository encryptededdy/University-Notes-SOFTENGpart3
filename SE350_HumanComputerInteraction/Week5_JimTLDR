Lecture 1: Visual Perception
	Learning Outcomes:
		- see humans as processing machine
		- identify components about visual perception
		- see how visual imparement affects usability
		- lay groundwork for futher topics

	1.1: General
		- computer interface predominantly visual

		Human Model
		INPUT: senses

		PROCESS: cognition (knowledge, skills, reasoning)

		STORAGE: memory

		OUTPUT: actions/speech

	1.2: Current systems
		- most things are visual and audio

	1.3: Vision
		- light hits eye
		- images upside down 

		- cones for colour
		- rods for low light (monotone greyscale)
		- humans see blue light lowest

		- luminance = brightness 
		- central: more cones and better detail
		- peripheral: less cells, more rods

		6/6 or 20/20 is good vision.

		- presbyopia: hardening of lenses after age 35

	1.4: Depth Perception
		- use overlap
		- or motion parallax

	1.5: Reading
		- word shapes good
		- therefore allcaps bad

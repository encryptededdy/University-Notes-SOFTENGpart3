Lectures
	1	Visual Perception
	2	Visual Aesthetics

Lecture 1: Visual Perception
	Learning Outcomes:
		- see humans as processing machine
		- identify components about visual perception
		- see how visual imparement affects usability
		- lay groundwork for futher topics

	1.1: General
		- computer interface predominantly visual

		Human Model
		INPUT: senses

		PROCESS: cognition (knowledge, skills, reasoning)

		STORAGE: memory

		OUTPUT: actions/speech

	1.2: Current systems
		- most things are visual and audio

	1.3: Vision
		- light hits eye
		- images upside down 

		- cones for colour
		- rods for low light (monotone greyscale)
		- humans see blue light lowest

		- luminance = brightness 
		- central: more cones and better detail
		- peripheral: less cells, more rods

		6/6 or 20/20 is good vision.

		- presbyopia: hardening of lenses after age 35

	1.4: Depth Perception
		- use overlap
		- or motion parallax

	1.5: Reading
		- word shapes good
		- therefore allcaps bad

Lecture 2: Visual Aesthetics
	Learning Objectives:
		- Principles of Aesthetics
		- How they apply to UI design
		- Interface patterns (how they improve designs)
		- Standards and Toolkits in terms of usability

	2.1: Aesthetics
		- Philosophical: Finding criteria for aesthetics
		- Emperical: Experimental measuring of what people find aesthetic

		-Visual Aesthetics affect user perception
			- more usable
			- more trustworthy
			- more error tolerant

		- Good lookig software has advantage over others

		TED TALK
			- positive experience makes you more creative
			- fear makes you focus

	2.2: Design Guide Principles
		2.2.1: Balance
			- Balance is having equal weight of screen elements at top/right/bottom/left sides

			Symmetry	- formal balance
						- mirror image
						- can be in any orientation

			Asymmetry	- informal balance
						- balance that doesn't rely on symmetry
						- No rule/limit to asymmetrical balance

		2.2.2: Emphasis
			Can control attention by creating dominance

			- Contrast
				- Can use luminance
			- Placement
				- Central vison dominant
			- Isolation
				- Dominance by thing being there alone

		2.2.3: Unity
			Relationship of how individual parts mesh together

			- Careful placement of components
				- Grouping
				- Connecting/Disconnecting things from each other

			- Use pre-existing things that are good

	2.3: Design patterns
		Review of solution to design challenge

		Format:
			-Problem
			-Solution
			-Examples
			-Implementation/Comments

	2.4: Guidelines/Standards
		- Things that are common, have become standard
		- Endorsement 
			- By national/international body (ANSI, ISO)
			- Community run/nonprofit (W3C)
		- May not actually comply to standard even if they say they do


		Examples:
			-ISO
			-Government (UK, USA, NZ)
			-OS
			-W3c word lwide web consortium

	2.5: Toolkits
		- lets you add functionality created by others easily and quickly
			- provides "easy way out"
			- good for agile dev

		- Can have big communities using the modules
			- consistency
			- can ask others if doesn't work for you

		Drupal.org has many open source Content Management System (CNS) for website/apps

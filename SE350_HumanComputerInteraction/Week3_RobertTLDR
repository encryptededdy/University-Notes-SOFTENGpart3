Lecture 1: Usability Testing 2
	Learning Objectives:
		- Develop usability test plans
		- write usability test report
		- understand ethical requirements

	1.1: Planning
		- plan everything 
		- include obvious things as they may be overlooked later

		Overview:
			Product under test
			Test objectives
			Participants Required
			Equipment needed
			Tasks to Undertake
			Data to be collected
			Test procedure
			Data analysis plan

		1.1.1: Participants
			- let people be themselves
				- role play if can't
			- match aspects of target audience
			- 10-12 good for single product
			- 30 good for comparing products & statistically valid results

		1.1.2: Tasks
			- be specific in what you want participants to do
			- record completion paths possible
				- don't show to participants
				- do it yourself to figure out how
				- do mini heuristic evaluation

			Task Order: (learning effect)
				- consider what order you want them to do
					- some make sense to try before another
				- record differences that participants take in order to complete tasks

		1.1.3: Data Collection
			- questionnaire easy way to get satisfaction data
			- open questions give you good data about problems
			- closed quesitons let you quantify things

		1.1.4: Procedures
			- figure out how to reward participants
			- cater for long sessions
			- power plugs
			- time to reset between participants

		1.1.5: Writing Script
			- write one to ensure you don't forget instructions

		1.1.6: Analysis Plan
			- how to turn raw data into somehting that can be compared
			- plan how to report findings
			- time, error count, and questionnaire findings are good metrics to use

			Pilot test on people 
			- test on few people to get feel

		1.1.7: Report
			- document reporting findings
			- video of participatns doing their thing

	1.2: Ethics
		- need ethics approval if doing things involving people/animals
		- lots of paperwork, and need to do to publish at journals
		- companies require this too

		Basics:
			- Informed consent: people know what they're getting into
			- people don't have to participate
				- can refuse/withdraw at any time
			- questionnaires are private

		Professionalism
			- treat people with respect
			- tread devs with respect
			- ensure report is fair, accurate, tidy and make sense

Lecture 2: Conceptual Design
	Learning Objectives:
		- know why conceptual design before physical design
		- know how to design conceptually
			- persona & scenario
			- brainstorm, card sort, mind map
			- process diagram	

	2.1: General
		- consider who you're designing for
		- organise design ideas

		- structuring information space and creating alternate solutions
		- determine which concept to do

	2.2: Persona
		- archetypes of actual users
		- defined by their goals and attributes
		- reflection of information form data collections
		- can contain characteristics from multiple potential users

		Format/Structure
		- name & photo
		- goals and motivation
		- behaviours and personality
		- relevant background

		- should be able to imagine/refer to them as real person.

		Advantages:
			- quick and easy to crate
			- consistent model for team members
			- make user "real"
		Disadvantages:
			- difficult to create if target audience is international
			- too many personas make work harder
			- risk of making too many assumptions

		Example from slides
			- name and photo
			- what they need (simplicity, efficiency, whatever)
			- background paragraph
			- age
			- occupation
			- financial situation
			- location
			- educaitonal background
			- family size
			- behaviours on a scale
			- technology, and confidence using it
			- goals
			- likes and dislikes

	2.3: Scenarios
		- plain English description of task
		- describes 
			- goal
			- initial conditions
			- activities
			- outcomes
		- paired with persona
		- uses persona and not abstraction (use-case uses this)

		- PACT:
			- People
				- person/persona
			- Activities
				- what they want to do
			- Context
				- physical context of them doing it
			- Technology
				- what technology used to help them do it

			Then describe scenario

	2.4: Design Ideation
		2.4.1: Brainstorm
			- team activity
			- gets ideas out quickly
			- work in parallel by breaking up into smaller groups
			- makes lots of material that needs to be organised

		2.4.2: Card Sort
			- group by user types
			- generates text for various UI elements

			Advantages:
				- quick and easy
				- let you know how people organise information
			Disadvantages:
				- solutions and imply structures
				- hard to navigate if big

		2.4.3: Mind map
			- semi structured brainstorm

			Advantages:
				- easy
				- cluster similar things
				- graphical view
			Disadvantages:
				- knowledge of problem space required
				- no formal semantics

		2.4.4: Process Diagram
			- flow charts
			- STNs

Lecture 3: GWEBS
	3.1: Auckland Layout Manager
		- java GUI manager for resizing
		- recalculate how big htings should be based on layout specifications
		- no hardcoding
		- gridbag tied to grid specifications created in code
		- ALM uses coordinated to do this
		- partial tabstop order
		- has window stacking and tiling

	3.2: Acti-Gaze
		- problem being those who can't use traditional input methods
			- could be things like RSI or disabilities
		- use eye tracking as input method
		- uses colouring of various links in visual area

	3.3: Levels of HCI
		Deep Level
			- make systems stable and reliable for good UI

		GUI technology level
			- improve GUI technology to make better GUI effectively
			
		Interaction Design level
			- design good UI, look and feel

Lecture 1: Usability Testing 2
	Learning Objectives:
		- Develop usability test plans
		- write usability test report
		- understand ethical requirements

	1.1: Planning
		- plan everything 
		- include obvious things as they may be overlooked later

		Overview:
			Product under test
			Test objectives
			Participants Required
			Equipment needed
			Tasks to Undertake
			Data to be collected
			Test procedure
			Data analysis plan

		1.1.1: Participants
			- let people be themselves
				- role play if can't
			- match aspects of target audience
			- 10-12 good for single product
			- 30 good for comparing products & statistically valid results

		1.1.2: Tasks
			- be specific in what you want participants to do
			- record completion paths possible
				- don't show to participants
				- do it yourself to figure out how
				- do mini heuristic evaluation

			Task Order: (learning effect)
				- consider what order you want them to do
					- some make sense to try before another
				- record differences that participants take in order to complete tasks

		1.1.3: Data Collection
			- questionnaire easy way to get satisfaction data
			- open questions give you good data about problems
			- closed quesitons let you quantify things

		1.1.4: Procedures
			- figure out how to reward participants
			- cater for long sessions
			- power plugs
			- time to reset between participants

		1.1.5: Writing Script
			- write one to ensure you don't forget instructions

		1.1.6: Analysis Plan
			- how to turn raw data into somehting that can be compared
			- plan how to report findings
			- time, error count, and questionnaire findings are good metrics to use

			Pilot test on people 
			- test on few people to get feel

		1.1.7: Report
			- document reporting findings
			- video of participatns doing their thing

	1.2: Ethics
		- need ethics approval if doing things involving people/animals
		- lots of paperwork, and need to do to publish at journals
		- companies require this too

		Basics:
			- Informed consent: people know what they're getting into
			- people don't have to participate
				- can refuse/withdraw at any time
			- questionnaires are private

		Professionalism
			- treat people with respect
			- tread devs with respect
			- ensure report is fair, accurate, tidy and make sense

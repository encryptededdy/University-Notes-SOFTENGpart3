Lectures:
	1	Grouping
	2	Lines and Borders

Lecture 1: Grouping
	Learning Objectives: 
		- when grouping is good
		- how to group
		- gestalt principles

	1.1: Sorting
		- card sorting good way to group things when put ideas down

		can sort by:
		- alphabetical
		- chronological
		- geographic

		- topic
		- task
		- audience
		- metaphor

	1.2: Gestalt Principles
		- explain factors used to group things
		- find simplest solutions 

		1.2.1: Proximity
			- if close together then seen as belonging
			- horizontal, vertical and equidistant proximity depending on how you want to group things

		1.2.2: Similarity
			- if similar size, shape or colour will seem related
			- can use similarity for emphasis (make something out of place)

		1.2.3: Common Fate
			- objects that move together are related
			- aligned dropdowns seem related to something

		1.2.4: Closure
			- imcomplete things with gaps can be seen as complete [ ]

		1.2.5: Continuity
			- want to see things as smooth changes instead of abrupt changes
			- eyes like to follow things that we see form curves

		1.2.6: Area Principle
			- object with smaller area seen as separate figure and not ground/background.

		1.2.7: Symmetry
			- symmetric things seen as complete around its centre
			- rotational, translational, and reflectional symmetry

		1.2.8: Surroundedness
			- central thing seen as figure
			- things surrounding it seen as ground

		1.2.9: Pragnanz Principle
			- we see things in the most simplest things
			- can see face in :)
			- if principles conflicting then user not sure what it means

	1.3: Lines and Borders
		- visual clues for grouping
		- lines don't have to be actual life

Lecture 2: Lines and Borders
	Learning Outcomes:
		- relationship of wireframing
		- why use
		- style options
		- how used in data and tables

	2.1: Wireframing
		- make physical design from conceptual one
		- identify areas needing separations (lines & borders)

		- hand draw/balsamiq (lofi prototyping)

	2.2: Lines and Borders
		- create physical grouping

		examples of use:
			- boders use same colour, thickness and curviture of font
			- keep consistency with font scheme

			- some things make use of hairline borders to separate things
			- create pseudogrid structure

			- don't have to be solid lines, dotted lines work well too

	2.3: Corner Treatment
		- don't have to be orthogonal
		- can be diagonal or curved
		- keep corner scheme consistent over interface

	2.4: Angles
		- don't have to make site completely vertical and horizontal lines
		- will make site stand out if contain non-traditional angles

	2.5: Curves
		- add motion and liveness
		- circular design calming

	2.6: Doing it wrong
		- don't put lines between paragraphs of text (disrupt)
		- group correctly

	2.7: Tables
		- use of columns and rows to visually separate data
		- all cells in column should have strong similarity
		- alignment also important

		- heading should be separate but not dominant
		- same with colour and line scheme

		- can encode data with coloured backgrounds to show more information

	2.8: Graphs
		- makes things easier to compare and see trends
		- can make use of images/icons to encode more information

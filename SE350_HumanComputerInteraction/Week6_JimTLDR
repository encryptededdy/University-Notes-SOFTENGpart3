	2	Lines and Borders

Lecture 1: Grouping
	Learning Objectives: 
		- when grouping is good
		- how to group
		- gestalt principles

	1.1: Sorting
		- card sorting good way to group things when put ideas down

		can sort by:
		- alphabetical
		- chronological
		- geographic

		- topic
		- task
		- audience
		- metaphor

	1.2: Gestalt Principles
		- explain factors used to group things
		- find simplest solutions 

		1.2.1: Proximity
			- if close together then seen as belonging
			- horizontal, vertical and equidistant proximity depending on how you want to group things

		1.2.2: Similarity
			- if similar size, shape or colour will seem related
			- can use similarity for emphasis (make something out of place)

		1.2.3: Common Fate
			- objects that move together are related
			- aligned dropdowns seem related to something

		1.2.4: Closure
			- imcomplete things with gaps can be seen as complete [ ]

		1.2.5: Continuity
			- want to see things as smooth changes instead of abrupt changes
			- eyes like to follow things that we see form curves

		1.2.6: Area Principle
			- object with smaller area seen as separate figure and not ground/background.

		1.2.7: Symmetry
			- symmetric things seen as complete around its centre
			- rotational, translational, and reflectional symmetry

		1.2.8: Surroundedness
			- central thing seen as figure
			- things surrounding it seen as ground

		1.2.9: Pragnanz Principle
			- we see things in the most simplest things
			- can see face in :)
			- if principles conflicting then user not sure what it means

	1.3: Lines and Borders
		- visual clues for grouping
		- lines don't have to be actual life

Lecture 1 - Introduction
	1.1 - What is HCI
		Definition
			Discipline concerned with DESIGN, EVALUATION and IMPLEMENTATION of interative computing systems for human use.

		- people use computers to do task
		- Good HCI implementation feel transparent & natural

	1.2 - User Interface
		Definition
			point where two systems meet and interact

	1.3 - HCI in practice
		Goal: providing good user experience (UX)
		- design with user in mind
		- think about new ways people could interact with computers in order to carry out tasks

Lecture 2 - User Requirements
	Learning Objectives
		- when user requirements gathered
		- analysis of problem domain
		- understand types of stakeholders
		- collecting data (interviews, focus groups, questionnaires)
		- Create user profiles

	2.1	User requirements
		Ranking:
			- Mandatory
			- Desirable
			- Optional
			- future thought
		- Get at beginning

	2.2 - Requirements Collection
		Have to identify
			- People involved
			- things they use
			- processes involved
			- info required
			- constraints
			- inputs required
			- outputs created

		Model information:
			- describe those that do the work
			- document use cases & stories
			- create formal diagrams

	2.3 - Exploring Domain
		- Identify all stakeholders
		- Consider all, focus on primary

		Four Types:
		- Primary: uses design directly
		- Secondary: provide input & output for design
		- Facilitator: maintain/develop it
		- Indirect: affevted by use but doesn't use it (supervisor)

		- Understand competition, use what works well for others
		- Sometimes better to use another system than make a new one from scratch

	2.4 - Discovery Process

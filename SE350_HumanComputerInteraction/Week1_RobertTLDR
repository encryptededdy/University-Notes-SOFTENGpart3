Lecture 1 - Introduction
	1.1 - What is HCI
		Definition
			Discipline concerned with DESIGN, EVALUATION and IMPLEMENTATION of interative computing systems for human use.

		- people use computers to do task
		- Good HCI implementation feel transparent & natural

	1.2 - User Interface
		Definition
			point where two systems meet and interact

	1.3 - HCI in practice
		Goal: providing good user experience (UX)
		- design with user in mind
		- think about new ways people could interact with computers in order to carry out tasks

Lecture 2 - User Requirements
	Learning Objectives
		- when user requirements gathered
		- analysis of problem domain
		- understand types of stakeholders
		- collecting data (interviews, focus groups, questionnaires)
		- Create user profiles

	2.1	User requirements
		Ranking:
			- Mandatory
			- Desirable
			- Optional
			- future thought
		- Get at beginning

	2.2 - Requirements Collection
		Have to identify
			- People involved
			- things they use
			- processes involved
			- info required
			- constraints
			- inputs required
			- outputs created

		Model information:
			- describe those that do the work
			- document use cases & stories
			- create formal diagrams

	2.3 - Exploring Domain
		- Identify all stakeholders
		- Consider all, focus on primary

		Four Types:
		- Primary: uses design directly
		- Secondary: provide input & output for design
		- Facilitator: maintain/develop it
		- Indirect: affevted by use but doesn't use it (supervisor)

		- Understand competition, use what works well for others
		- Sometimes better to use another system than make a new one from scratch

	2.4 - Discovery Process
		Filter:
			Physical - physical aspect of activity
			Cultural - relationships between people
			Functional - What happens
			Informational - Information involved

		Collect this data and organise it

	2.5 - Collection

		- Observation: watch others perform activity
		- Elliciation: indirectly obtain information about it
		

	2.6 - Ellicitation
		Direct:
			-Interviews:
				ONSITE - Let them remember aspects about job
				OFFSITE - People aren't distracted by work around them
			-Focus Group:
				- Need moderator to keep discussion
				- Need clear outcomes defined
				- Best if have peer relationship

				ADVANTAGES:
					- Inexpensive/easy to setup
					- Insight into people attitude
					- Identify outlier opinion
				DISADVANTAGES:
					- Only represent one group's view
					- Strong voice and influence group
					- Not statically significant
					- No usability information
		Indirect:
			- Corporate documentation/Logs/Notes/Questionnaires

			Questionnaires:
				- Familiar, can ask open & closed ended questions
				- Multitide of possible response formats (radio buttons, short answer, yes/no, ranges)
				-SurveyMonkey/LimeSurvey

				ADVANTAGES:
					- No face to face contact
					- Get infomation for primary stokeholder profile
					- double check feedback from 1to1 interviews
					- can reach larger audience

				DISADVANTAGES:
					- Questions can be vague
					- People don't like long questionnaires
					- Closed ended Qs, restrict response
					- Open ended Qs, hard to quantify
					- Total survey error

	2.7 - Observation
		Direct:
			- Ethnographic methods, going to worksite and observing people
			- Your presence will have an impact (change how they would normally do things/ annoy them/ raise unecessary questions (privacy))

		Indirect:
			- Use of recording devices to do this remontely

		-Distributed Cognition:	offloading cognitive tasks to objects (post it/whiteboard)

	2.8 - Modelling/Documenting Requirements:
		-Collate all data from discovery

		Make:	- Mission Statement
			-Project Goals
				- Value proposition
				- how it addresses needs
			- Project Scope
				- what design includes
				- external constraints (time/money)
				- how to decide if meets proposal

		- Requirements Document
			- Users (Who, what they're like, what tasks they will do)
			- Requirements (Functional features, Informational features)
			- IO medium
			- Constraints 
			
		- Project Management Document
		- Usability Requirements

Lecture 3: Modelling & Documentation
	Learning Objectives: Learn to describe
		- Stakeholders
		- Tasks
		- Pathways between taskss
		- Major Uses

	3.1: Primary Stakeholder Profile
		Defines target user
		- context of use
		- cognitive ability
		- physical ability
		- individual profile

	3.2: Task Analysis
		- Documents how people do tasks
		- Explore requiements of proposed system OR document existing system

		[HTA] Hierarchical Task Analysis
			-Top down structured approach to documenting process

			Goal - Top level goal of task
			Plans - Order and condition to proceed
			Information - needed to do task
			Objects - physical objects involved
			Methods - How to do subtasks

			Structure
			1	open eyes
			2	get out of bed
				2.1	take blanket off
				2.2 turn around
				2.3	feet on ground
				2.4 stand up

		[STN] State transition network
			- Description of actions/evens possible at different point of system use/state

			- Can have heirarchical STN if multiple "modules" exist
			- Can potentially have many many states if have to accomodate for every possible combination of a form

		Try avoid having "escapes" for every possible part of doing tasks.
		Also same with putting "help menus" everywhere

	3.3: Use Cases
		- represent formal approach to interpret workflow/proecesses
		- Incorporated into UML

	3.4: Requirements to design
		- HCI emphasise users with wants & needs
		- User profile used to create persona
		- Task Analysis/Use cases make scenarios

	1	Text
	2	Colour
	3	Forms & Control

Lecture 1: Text
	Learning Objectives:
		- describe purpose of text
		- balance between readility and artistic font
		- why fonts are readable
		- use characters of text
		- choose appropriate scheme for use

	1.1: Human Issues
		- people still scan text if search bar exist
		- still very much use text to navigate UI
		- paper based interface good, kindles exist
		- active reading helps (putting pen/cursor over text you're reading)

	1.2: Text in design
		- commentary text: system status
		- instrumental text: "working/functioning" text

		- needs to be:
			- legibile: discern words
			- readible
			- external factors (screen resolution & brightness)

		- we read lowercase better than UPPERCASE (shapes)

	1.3: Typography
		- xheight = height between base and mean line
		- ascender = bit sticking up like top of "d"
		- descender = bit pointing down like in "p"
		- body size = ascender to desencder height

		- serif = flicky bits
		- sans serif = no flicky bits
		- not sure which is more readible

	1.4: Font Features
		1.4.1: Title Fonts
			- display fonts better for titles and headings
			- get attention
			- not installed on all machines
			- hard to read paragraphs

		1.4.2: Body Fonts
			- easier to read in paragraphs
			- consistency
			- more neutral

		1.4.3: Proportional & Monospaced
			- proportional more readable
			- monospaced has its place (code)

		1.4.4: Font Size
			- uses pt, or em, or px
			- varies by device properties
			- perceived size not same as real size as font structures different

			- smaller fonts need better resolution
			- reading from further needs larger font size
			- good contrast needed to read things efficiently
			- text can be scanned or read char for char

 		1.4.5: Font weight & Style
 			Weight:
 				- if different weight then create visual contrast

 			Font Style:
	 			- italics and underline
	 			- underline generally used for hyperlink

	 		- don't use too many of these things, makes it look confusing

	 	1.4.6: Spacing
	 		- spacing between lines of text
	 		- is called ledding
	 		- increasing this improves reading speed (at cost of space)

	 	1.4.7: Alignment
	 		- use left or justified
	 		- right is harder to read

	 	1.4.8: Lengths and margins
	 		- longer lines harder to read
	 		- aim for 75-100

	 		- aim for short lines with large margins for read speed
	 		- try medium if doesn't work for you
